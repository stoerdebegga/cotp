I believe that security is of paramount importance, especially in this digital world. I created cotp because I needed a
minimalist, secure, desktop accessible software to manage my two-factor authentication codes.

# Overview

## Interface

cotp is written with simplicity in mind, the interface is quite minimalist and intuitive as command line apps should be.

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/459912.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/459912)

If you are familiar with the command line interface using cotp will not be a problem. Just type `cotp` to enter the TUI
dashboard. Type `i` to get some instruction. Otherwise just enter `cotp --help`.

In the first run you will be prompted to insert a password to initialize the database.

## Encryption

This program relies on only one database file encrypted
with [XChaCha20Poly1305](https://docs.rs/chacha20poly1305/latest/chacha20poly1305/) authenticated encryption
and [Argon2id](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2) for key derivation.

It also uses [AES-GCM](https://docs.rs/aes-gcm/latest/aes_gcm/) to import from encrypted Aegis backups.

## Compatibility

cotp can generate both **TOTP** and **HOTP** codes, compliant with **rfc6238** and **rfc4226** specifications. Also, it
is possible to customize settings like **HMAC algorithm** and **digits**, to provide compatibility to other two-factor
authentication systems.

Latest releases also include support for Steam, Yandex, MOTP codes and code copying from SSH Remote Shell.

## Cross Plaform

cotp should be easily compiled on the most used platform, but it is mostly tested on Linux and Windows.

# Install

## Arch Linux and arch-based distributions

Arch Linux has an [official package](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/cotp) in the [extra] repository:

```
pacman -S cotp
```

Additionally if you wish to compile and run the Git HEAD version instead of the current stable release,
an AUR package [cotp-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/cotp-git) can be installed using the
[usual instructions](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_User_Repository#Installing_and_upgrading_packages)
or your favorite AUR helper like [paru](https://github.com/morganamilo/paru) (`paru -S cotp-git`).

## NixOS

Check the [official package](https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=23.11&from=0&size=50&sort=relevance&type=packages&query=cotp).

## Other linux distributions and \*nix

Before beginning check that you have the required build dependencies to use the rust compiler.

You need to install the **libxcb-devel** dependency, needed for clipboard coping in X11:

- Debian based: `sudo apt install libxcb1-dev libx11-dev libxcb-shape0-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev libxkbcommon-dev`
- Fedora / RHEL based: `sudo dnf install libX11-devel`
- Void Linux `sudo xbps-install -S libxcb-devel`

## macOS

```
brew install cotp
```

## Windows

Building is supported with both `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` and `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` toolchains.

If you want to use `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` you will need to install
the [Visual C++ 2019 Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/it/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=BuildTools&rel=16)

Once you have the rust toolchain installed just run `cargo install cotp`.

### Use the crates.io repository

Just type `cargo install cotp` and wait for the installation.

### Clone the GitHub repository and manually install

You can build cotp using these commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/replydev/cotp.git
cargo install --path cotp/
```

# Migration from other apps

cotp supports TOTP codes migration from various apps.
Some needs to be converted using simple python script you can find listed in the table below.

## How to convert

Once you got the correct files run the right python script located in the **converters/** folder in this source code.

**Example:**
`python authy.py path/to/database.xml converted.json`

It will convert the database in a json format readable by cotp.

To terminate the import:
`cotp import --authy --path path/to/converted_database.json`

# Configuration

By default database is located in `$HOME/.cotp/db.cotp`. If you want to use a different path, you can use `COTP_DB_PATH` environment variable. 
Here is an example of how to do this in bash:
```bash
$ COTP_DB_PATH=/home/user/.local/custom-folder/db.cotp /usr/bin/cotp
```

# Planned features

Currently, there is not any planned feature. If you need something new that could improve the software feel free to open
an issue.

# Contribution

I created this project for my own needs, but I would be happy if this little program is useful to someone else, and I
gratefully accept any pull requests.
